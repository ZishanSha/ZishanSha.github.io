I am a computer science student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite 120 CPSC Labs

* Lab 04 -Part 2:

  This was a fun lab because, through this lab, I learned how to implement a simple two-player guessing game in C++. It helped me practice using essential input/output functions like cin and cout, which are necessary for interacting with users. I also better-understood control structures such as if-else statements to check conditions (like whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low). This lab also gave me hands-on experience in using variables to store and compare values and managing the program's flow with conditional checks to handle different scenarios, such as winning or losing. Overall, it helped me reinforce key concepts of programming, including user input handling, logical decision-making, and basic flow control

* Lab 08 -Part 2:

  This was one of my favourite labs because, by doing this lab, I learned how to use nested loops effectively to create complex patterns in C++. I gained a deeper understanding of how the outer loop controls the overall structure of the output while the inner loops handle specific parts of the pattern, such as printing dashes and bars. I also practiced using constants to control the flow of the program, ensuring that the loops iterate the correct number of times based on the value of kCounterMax. Additionally, this lab helped me enhance my skills in formatting output by printing a combination of characters (dashes, asterisks, and bars) on each line, with the number of characters changing dynamically. Overall, it reinforced key concepts of loops, string manipulation, and structuring code to produce a desired output.

* Lab 09- Part 2:

  From doing this lab, I learned how to handle file input and output in C++ using the stream class, which allowed me to read data from a file. I gained experience in checking if the file opened successfully and handling errors, such as if the file was missing or malformed. I also learned how to extract data from a file using the >> operator and validate that the input meets specific conditions, such as ensuring the number read from the file falls within a valid range. Additionally, I improved my skills in combining file input with user input to create an interactive guessing game. By incorporating error handling for cases like invalid data or file access issues, I learned how to build more robust programs that can handle unexpected situations gracefully. This lab reinforced the importance of validating inputs, working with files, and structuring code to handle correct and incorrect scenarios effectively.
